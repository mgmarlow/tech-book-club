# [Tech Book Club](https://techbookclub.dev/)

## Development

Clone and install dependencies:

```
gh repo clone mgmarlow/tech-book-club
cd ./tech-book-club
yarn
```

The book list is fetched from Airtable during compilation. In order to run the application, you need to add a `.env` file to the root directory of the project:

```
AT_API_URL=
AT_BASE_ID=
AT_API_KEY=
```

Reach out to me for the application credentials.
