## Welcome to tech book club

Hello! Welcome to the [tech book club archive](https://techbookclub.dev/archive).

I update the archive twice a month with articles that explore classic computer science literature and apply it to everyday software engineering. The articles are packed full of notes, code samples, and analysis related to what the club is reading that month.

If you're interested in the club's origins, take a look at [our story](https://techbookclub.dev#story). Otherwise, this post is a quick introduction to what's coming up in the next few weeks.

### 1. Talking micro frontends

[Micro Frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html) by Cam Jackson.

This foundational Thoughtwork's article is an excellent introduction to microservice architecture for frontend applications. However, the example included in the article is a little outdated.

In the next few weeks, I'm going to walk through an alternative implementation that uses modern monorepo tools to help address concerns related to scalability and developer experience.

### 2. Exploring SICP

[_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) by Abelson, et al.

Functional languages like Scheme enable incredible expressivity and unique approaches for solving problems. Here's what's coming up:

- A look at why proper tail calls are important and why they're missing in JavaScript, a language that is directly inspired by Scheme.
- A fun detour with lambdas that answers the question, "how can I make an anonymous function call itself"?

Thanks for reading and stay tuned!
