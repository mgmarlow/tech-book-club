## Welcome to the tech book club newsletter

Thanks for taking a look at the tech book club newsletter! Together we're going to explore classic computer science literature and learn how to apply it to the everyday.

I'm going to kick things off with articles on two topics:

### 1. [Micro frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html), the foundational Thoughtworks article

The reading does a great job explaining the pros and cons of micro frontends, but is accompanied by an example that is rather outdated. I'm going to build on the example in the article with some modern monorepo tools that make the approach more scalable and easier to manage.

### 2. _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ chapter 1

We'll cover higher-order functions, closures, and the types of affordances that functional languages like Scheme enable.

- A look at why proper tail calls are important and why they're missing in JavaScript, a language that is directly inspired by Scheme.
- A fun detour with lambdas that answers the question, "how can I make an anonymous function call itself"?

Stay tuned!
