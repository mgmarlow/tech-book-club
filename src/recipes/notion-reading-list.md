[Notion](https://notion.so) is a phenomenal tool for notetaking and I've been singing its praises for the better part of a year. Zoe Chew has a great guide on [setting up a Notion reading list]("https://hackernoon.com/track-everything-you-read-and-your-notes-with-this-notion-template-x6u53wfc") to keep track of your Tech Book Club notes.

Here's a link to the [finished template]("https://www.notion.so/ba973ec2f0b84818bf9862257f70d463?v=1ace0dd4f57c4bfca8cb5bc4562eec5e") if you don't want to set it up yourself. Just open up the link and hit "Duplicate" in the upper-right corner.
